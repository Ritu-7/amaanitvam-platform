                Amaanitvam Foundation was founded by a group of passionate students who realized that structural social gaps could not be solved by distant charity alone. We believed that true change is direct, localized, and led by the youth.
              </p>

              <p class="type-body stagger-load">
                Driven by personal responsibility, we set out to build a highly transparent student pipeline—connecting learning excellence, hands-on professional mentorship, and direct community support. What began as a local effort soon expanded into a coordinated channel of care, powered entirely by active citizenship.
